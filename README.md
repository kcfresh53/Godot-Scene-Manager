# Godot-Scene-Manager
Allows users to make "native-like" android and IOS scene transitions


To use the addon you need to set the scene manager script as an Autoload and you are set. All you need to do is place your main scene under the "current_scene" node and pass your previous scene and next scene as a resource and you are good to go.

Future "native-like" control nodes will be added soon.
